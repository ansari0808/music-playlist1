The Music Playlist Application is a user-friendly program built using Python's Tkinter library, designed for managing and playing a personal music playlist. This application allows users to add, delete, and navigate through songs seamlessly while offering a simple graphical interface.

Features
Add Music: Users can easily add songs to their playlist by entering the music name in a dedicated entry field.

Delete Music: The application allows users to remove songs from the playlist. If the playlist is empty, it prompts an error message.

View Playlist: Users can refresh and view the current contents of their playlist, with each song displayed in a list format.

Playback Controls: The application provides buttons to play the next song, the previous song, the first song, and the last song in the playlist. Additionally, users can search for a specific song and play it directly.

Visual Feedback: When a song is played, a new window appears displaying the song title and appropriate messages, enhancing the user experience.

Error Handling: The application includes error handling to manage situations like trying to delete a song that isn't in the playlist or attempting to play songs when the playlist is empty.
